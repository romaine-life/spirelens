///   - Ascension curse (<c>AscensionManager</c> adds Ascender's Bane
///     via <c>player.Deck.AddInternal(ascendersBane, ...)</c>)
///   - Reward / shop / event cards (routed through
///     <c>CardPileCmd.Add → pile.AddInternal</c> eventually)
///
/// Whatever floor is appropriate is already set on
/// <c>CardModel.FloorAddedToDeck</c> by the game (Player.cs PopulateStartingDeck
